# Potentially Unused Files Report

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified several files that appear to be no longer needed following the optimization process. This report details each file and explains why it might be safe to remove.

## Files That Can Potentially Be Removed

### 1. `test.py`
**Reason**: This appears to be a standalone test script for ScrapeGraphAI with hardcoded API keys. It's not imported in any other files and serves the same purpose as functionality now available in `graph_scraper_utils.py`.

**Risk Level**: Low - This is a standalone test script not referenced elsewhere.

**Recommendation**: Safe to remove. The functionality it tests is now accessible through more modular code in `graph_scraper_utils.py`.

### 2. `create_directories.py`
**Reason**: This script creates necessary directories for the CV processing feature. This functionality is now likely handled by the centralized configuration module (`config.py`) which has directory creation capabilities through `config.ensure_dir()`.

**Risk Level**: Low to Medium - Directory creation is now handled by the configuration system.

**Recommendation**: Consider removing if you confirm that the directory creation is handled by `config.py` for all the paths specified in this script.

### 3. `test_word_template.py`
**Reason**: This is a standalone test script for the word template generator. It's not imported in any other files and appears to be used only for manual testing.

**Risk Level**: Low - This is a test script not referenced elsewhere.

**Recommendation**: Safe to remove if you have other tests covering the Word template functionality, such as integration tests.

### 4. `graph_scraper_utils.py`
**Reason**: While this file is imported in `job_details_utils.py`, there are indications the optimized code may have integrated these utilities directly. The imports in `job_details_utils.py` have fallback mechanisms, suggesting they expect this module might not be available.

**Risk Level**: High - This is still being referenced, even if with fallbacks.

**Recommendation**: Keep this file for now. Before removing, you would need to verify that all its functionality has been completely integrated into the optimized modules and update any references to it.

### 5. `future_low_effort_features.md`
**Reason**: This markdown document lists future features to implement, including "Centralize Configuration" (item #20) which has already been implemented according to README_OPTIMIZATION.md. This suggests the document might be outdated.

**Risk Level**: Very Low - This is a documentation file, not code.

**Recommendation**: Review if all items have been implemented, then either update the document to remove completed items or remove it entirely if it's no longer needed.

## Next Steps

1. Review each file listed above to confirm it's safe to remove
2. If the file references any functionality unique to that file, ensure that functionality is properly implemented elsewhere first
3. Consider creating a 'deprecated' folder to move these files to instead of deleting them outright, at least temporarily
4. Update any references to these files in documentation
5. Update the `.gitignore` file if any of these files or directories were specifically mentioned

## Note on Safe Removal

To safely remove files, you might want to first back them up or use version control:

```bash
# Create a 'deprecated' directory
mkdir -p deprecated

# Move files there instead of deleting
mv test.py deprecated/
mv create_directories.py deprecated/
mv test_word_template.py deprecated/
mv future_low_effort_features.md deprecated/

# Or if you're confident, remove them directly
# rm test.py create_directories.py test_word_template.py future_low_effort_features.md
