## Overview

JobsearchAI is a secure, multi-user system that matches job listings with candidate CVs using AI-powered semantic matching. It scrapes job data, processes CVs, finds suitable matches, generates personalized motivation letters and email texts, and converts them to Word documents. A comprehensive authentication system protects all functionality, while a web dashboard provides an intuitive interface for managing the system.

The codebase has been optimized with a centralized configuration module and utility packages that improve error handling, reduce code duplication, and enhance API usage without introducing breaking changes.

## System Components

The system consists of the following main components:

1.  **Authentication System**: Secure user registration, login, and session management with Flask-Login.
2.  **Job Data Acquisition**: Scrapes job listings using ScrapeGraphAI.
3.  **CV Processor**: Extracts and summarizes CV information using OpenAI.
4.  **Job Matcher**: Matches jobs with CVs using semantic understanding via OpenAI.
5.  **Motivation Letter Generator**: Creates personalized motivation letters and email texts.
6.  **Word Template Generator**: Converts letters to Word documents.
7.  **Dashboard**: Web interface for system interaction.
8.  **Centralized Configuration**: (`config.py`) Provides a single source of truth for configuration settings.
9.  **Utility Modules**: (`utils/`) Collection of utility modules for common operations with improved error handling.

For detailed information on each component, please refer to the files in the `Documentation/` directory:

-   [Authentication System](./Documentation/Authentication_System.md) - **NEW** Complete security implementation
-   [Job Data Acquisition](./Documentation/Job_Data_Acquisition.md)

-   [Code Optimization](./deprecated_20250427_211727/README_OPTIMIZATION.md)

## Code Optimization

The codebase has been optimized with several new modules:

1. **Centralized Configuration** (`config.py`): Provides a single source of truth for all configuration settings including paths, environment variables, and default parameters.

2. **Utility Modules** in the `utils/` package:
   - `utils/decorators.py`: Decorators for error handling, retries, caching, and execution timing.
   - `utils/file_utils.py`: Functions for common file operations with improved error handling.
   - `utils/api_utils.py`: Wrappers for OpenAI API operations with retries and caching.

Key benefits of these optimizations:
- No breaking changes - maintains full compatibility with existing code
- Improved error handling with consistent patterns across modules
- Reduced code duplication through centralized and reusable functionality
- Better API usage with caching, retries, and error handling
- Centralized configuration management
- Type hints for better IDE support and code quality

Currently optimized components:
- `job_matcher.py`: Fully optimized
- `job_details_utils.py`: Fully optimized
- `letter_generation_utils.py`: Fully optimized

See [README_OPTIMIZATION.md](./deprecated_20250427_211727/README_OPTIMIZATION.md) for detailed examples and usage.

## Basic Usage

### Authentication Setup

Before using the system, you need to set up the database and create user accounts:

```bash
# Initialize the database
python init_db.py

# Create an admin user (follow prompts)
python init_db.py --create-admin

# Test database connection
python init_db.py --test-connection
```

### Running the Dashboard

The primary way to interact with the system is through the web dashboard:

```bash
python dashboard.py
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser. You will be redirected to the login page where you can:

- **Login** with your username/email and password
- **Register** a new account if you don't have one
- Access all system functionality after authentication

Once logged in, the dashboard allows you to:

-   Upload and manage CVs
-   Run the job scraper with configurable parameters
-   Run the job matcher with CV selection and matching parameters
-   Run a combined process (scraping + matching)
-   View and manage job match results
-   Generate motivation letters with features like:
    - Automatic job detail extraction
    - Manual text input support
    - Bulk letter generation
    - Email text generation
    - Multiple output formats (HTML, DOCX)
-   View and manage generated files
-   Track progress of background operations

**Security Features:**
- All routes protected by authentication
- Secure password hashing
- Session management with "remember me" option
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Professional login/registration interface

### Running Components Manually

You can also run individual components via the command line. See the respective files in the `Documentation/` folder for specific instructions.

## System Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed and the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

API keys are required:
- OpenAI API key for AI features (CV processing, job matching, letter generation)
- ScrapeGraphAI configuration for job scraping

Set the OpenAI key in `process_cv/.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Configure ScrapeGraphAI in `job-data-acquisition/settings.json`.
