# Product Brief: JobSearchAI

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Author:** Claudio
**Status:** Draft for PM Review

---

## Executive Summary

**JobSearchAI** is an open-source personal automation tool that transforms the tedious manual job application process into an efficient, quality-controlled pipeline for technical professionals seeking better career opportunities in Switzerland. The system automates the complete application workflow—from intelligent job discovery on ostjob.ch through AI-powered Bewerbung generation to email delivery—while maintaining professional quality through mandatory human-in-the-loop review.

**The Problem:** Employed professionals exploring better opportunities face a unique friction: they want to proactively build their career pipeline without making job searching a second full-time job. Manual applications are tedious, time-consuming, and psychologically draining, leading to sporadic activity and missed opportunities. Existing solutions lack the combination of intelligent automation, quality control, and Swiss market optimization needed for professional applications.

**The Solution:** JobSearchAI leverages Playwright web scraping, OpenAI-powered matching and content generation, and a centralized Application Queue interface to automate 80%+ of repetitive work while ensuring every application receives human review before sending. Built specifically for the Swiss job market with professional German-language Bewerbung generation, the tool runs locally for complete privacy and control.

**MVP Focus:** The immediate goal is completing three critical missing components in 8-13 hours: (1) email sending via Python's smtplib, (2) data validation system ensuring application completeness, and (3) Application Queue UI for streamlined review and approval. Success means manually triggering a scrape, reviewing ready applications in 15-30 minutes, and confidently sending quality applications through the automated pipeline.

**Impact:** Transform job searching from an overwhelming occasional chore into a streamlined morning routine—review 10+ applications in under 30 minutes versus hours of manual work, increase application volume 5x (from 1-2/week to 5-10/week), and maintain consistent career exploration without burnout. The tool pays back its development time within 2-3 weeks of regular use.

## Problem Statement

Job seekers who are currently employed but exploring better opportunities face a unique challenge: they want to proactively search for their next career move without making job searching a second full-time job. The manual job application process is tedious, time-consuming, and repetitive, requiring:

- Manually browsing multiple job boards daily to find relevant positions
- Reading through dozens of job descriptions to identify good matches
- Crafting individualized cover letters for each application
- Copying and pasting information into various application forms
- Tracking which jobs have been applied to and following up

**The Current Reality:**
Even when employed with "time to spare," the psychological burden and repetitive nature of manual job applications creates friction that prevents consistent application activity. What could be a systematic, ongoing career development activity becomes an occasional chore that gets postponed.

**The Cost:**
- **Opportunity Cost:** Missing out on excellent positions simply because the application process feels overwhelming
- **Time Waste:** Hours spent on repetitive tasks that could be automated
- **Inconsistency:** Sporadic application activity instead of steady pipeline building
- **Decision Fatigue:** Having to make the same formatting and wording decisions repeatedly

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- LinkedIn "Easy Apply" only works for LinkedIn jobs and still requires manual interaction
- Generic job boards lack intelligent matching and require manual review of every listing
- Existing automation tools don't provide the quality control and personalization needed for professional applications
- No solution combines automated discovery, intelligent matching, quality document generation, and human-in-the-loop review

**Why Now:**
The convergence of AI-powered text generation (OpenAI), reliable web scraping tools (Playwright), and modern web frameworks makes it technically feasible to build a personal automation tool that maintains professional quality while eliminating repetitive work. This is also an engaging technical project that serves a real personal need.
