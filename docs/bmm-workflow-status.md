## Implementation Progress (Phase 4 Only)

### Current Sprint

**Story Queue:**
- BACKLOG: None (all stories drafted)
- TODO: None
- IN PROGRESS: Story 1.4 (Application Queue Integration Bridge) - CURRENT
- DONE: Stories 1.1 ✓, 1.2 ✓, 1.3 ✓ (13 story points completed)

#### DONE (Completed Stories)

- **Story 1.1:** Backend Infrastructure (Email + Validation) - 5 points ✓
- **Story 1.2:** Application Queue UI - 5 points ✓
- **Story 1.3:** Integration and Polish - 3 points ✓

#### IN PROGRESS (Approved for Development)

- **Story ID:** 1.4
- **Story Title:** Application Queue Integration Bridge
- **Story File:** `story-1.4.md`
- **Story Status:** Ready
- **Story Points:** 8 (estimated 7-9 hours)
- **Context File:** `story-context-1.4.xml`
- **Action:** DEV should run `dev-story` workflow to implement this story
- **Note:** Follow-up story to address critical missing bridge between match/letter generation and application queue

## What to do next

**Next Action:** Implement Story 1.4 (Application Queue Integration Bridge)

**Command to run:** Load `@dev` and run `*develop` to implement Story 1.4

**Agent to load:** Developer Agent (dev.md) for implementation

**Why this step:** 
- Story 1.4 is approved and ready for development (Status: Ready)
- Context file available at `story-context-1.4.xml` with comprehensive implementation guidance
- All dependencies complete (Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
- Estimated 7-9 hours for Story 1.4 completion (8 story points)
- Addresses critical missing bridge between match/letter generation and application queue

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. **Story 1:** Backend Infrastructure (Email + Validation) - 5 points
2. **Story 2:** Application Queue UI - 5 points
3. **Story 3:** Integration and Polish - 3 points
**Total:** 13 story points (13-17 hours estimated)

**Planning Phase Completed:** Comprehensive planning package generated:
- ✓ Technical Specification (`docs/tech-spec.md`) - Definitive implementation guide
- ✓ UX Specification (`docs/ux-specification.md`) - Complete UI/UX design
- ✓ Epic & Stories (`docs/epic-stories.md`) - 3 stories, 13 points total

**Product Brief:** Strategic foundation at `docs/product-brief-JobSearchAI-2025-10-15.md`

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Email: Python smtplib + Gmail SMTP (port 587)
- Validation: email-validator library, 0-100% completeness scoring
- UI: Bootstrap 5 + custom components, card-based layout
- Storage: File-based JSON (pending/sent/failed folders)

## Workflow Notes

- **Phase 1 Analysis:** 
  - ✓ Completed document-project - Generated 6 comprehensive documentation files
  - ✓ Completed brainstorm-project - Generated 25+ solutions via Five Whys + SCAMPER
  - ✓ Completed product-brief - Strategic foundation and MVP priorities identified

- **Phase 2 Planning:**
  - ✓ Completed plan-project - Generated tech-spec, UX-spec, and epic/stories
  - ✓ Project level confirmed: Level 1 (Coherent Feature - 2-3 stories, 1 epic)
  - ✓ Technical decisions finalized (no ambiguity remaining)
  - ✓ UX design completed with comprehensive component specifications

- **Key Decisions:**
  - Email automation via Python smtplib (simplest, most reliable)
  - Data validation with completeness scoring (0-100%)
  - Application Queue UI with Bootstrap 5 + custom components
  - 3 stories: Backend (5pts), UI (5pts), Integration (3pts) = 13 points total

- **Phase 3 Solutioning:** SKIPPED (Level 1 projects skip Phase 3)

- **Phase 4 Implementation:**
  - ✓ Story 1.1 completed - Backend Infrastructure (Email + Validation) - 5 points ✓
  - ✓ Story 1.2 completed - Application Queue UI - 5 points ✓
  - ✓ Story 1.3 completed - Integration and Polish - 3 points ✓
  - → Story 1.4 IN PROGRESS - Application Queue Integration Bridge - 8 points (follow-up story)
  - Total completed: 13 story points, Total remaining: 8 story points
  - Epic progress: 62% complete (13/21 story points)

## Decisions Log

- **2025-10-16**: Story 1.4 (Application Queue Integration Bridge) marked ready for development by SM agent. This is a follow-up story after successful completion of Stories 1.1-1.3 (13 story points). Moved to IN PROGRESS. Context file available at story-context-1.4.xml. Ready for DEV agent to implement.
- **2025-10-16**: Stories 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 completed successfully (13 story points total). Email automation epic foundation complete.
