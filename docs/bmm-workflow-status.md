## Project Details

**Project Level:** 1 - Coherent Feature
- ✓ Selected: Level 1 - Small feature (2-3 stories, 1 epic)
- Description: Perfect for the 3 MVP priorities (email sending + validation + queue UI)
- Output: Tech-spec + Epic + 2-3 Stories
- Decision Date: 2025-10-15

**Project Type:** Web Application
**Greenfield/Brownfield:** Brownfield (existing codebase)
**Has UI Components:** Yes
**Documentation Status:** Needs comprehensive documentation

## Implementation Progress (Phase 4 Only)

*This section will be populated when Phase 4 begins*

**Story Queue:**
- BACKLOG: TBD
- TODO: None
- IN PROGRESS: None
- DONE: 0 stories (0 points)

## What to do next

**Next Action:** Begin implementation of Story 1 (Backend Infrastructure)

**Command to run:** Start with `@dev` to implement Story 1 (email sender + validation modules)

**Agent to load:** Developer Agent (James) for implementation

**Why this step:** 
- Planning phase complete with all specifications ready
- Tech-spec provides definitive implementation guidance
- UX-spec defines complete interface design
- Story 1 (Backend Infrastructure) has no dependencies - can start immediately
- Estimated 5-7 hours for Story 1 completion

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. **Story 1:** Backend Infrastructure (Email + Validation) - 5 points
2. **Story 2:** Application Queue UI - 5 points
3. **Story 3:** Integration and Polish - 3 points
**Total:** 13 story points (13-17 hours estimated)

**Planning Phase Completed:** Comprehensive planning package generated:
- ✓ Technical Specification (`docs/tech-spec.md`) - Definitive implementation guide
- ✓ UX Specification (`docs/ux-specification.md`) - Complete UI/UX design
- ✓ Epic & Stories (`docs/epic-stories.md`) - 3 stories, 13 points total

**Product Brief:** Strategic foundation at `docs/product-brief-JobSearchAI-2025-10-15.md`

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Email: Python smtplib + Gmail SMTP (port 587)
- Validation: email-validator library, 0-100% completeness scoring
- UI: Bootstrap 5 + custom components, card-based layout
- Storage: File-based JSON (pending/sent/failed folders)

## Workflow Notes

- **Phase 1 Analysis:** 
  - ✓ Completed document-project - Generated 6 comprehensive documentation files
  - ✓ Completed brainstorm-project - Generated 25+ solutions via Five Whys + SCAMPER
  - ✓ Completed product-brief - Strategic foundation and MVP priorities identified

- **Phase 2 Planning:**
  - ✓ Completed plan-project - Generated tech-spec, UX-spec, and epic/stories
  - ✓ Project level confirmed: Level 1 (Coherent Feature - 2-3 stories, 1 epic)
  - ✓ Technical decisions finalized (no ambiguity remaining)
  - ✓ UX design completed with comprehensive component specifications

- **Key Decisions:**
  - Email automation via Python smtplib (simplest, most reliable)
  - Data validation with completeness scoring (0-100%)
  - Application Queue UI with Bootstrap 5 + custom components
  - 3 stories: Backend (5pts), UI (5pts), Integration (3pts) = 13 points total

- **Phase 3 Solutioning:** SKIPPED (Level 1 projects skip Phase 3)

- **Ready for Phase 4 Implementation:**
  - All specifications complete and ready for development
  - Story 1 can start immediately (no dependencies)
  - Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks (13-17 hours total)
