## Current Status

**Current Phase:** 1-Analysis
**Current Workflow:** document-project
**Overall Progress:** 5%

## Phase Completion

- [ ] **Phase 1: Analysis** (In Progress)
  - [ ] document-project (Analyst) - Generate brownfield codebase documentation
  - [ ] brainstorm-project (Analyst) - Explore enhancement ideas (optional)
  - [ ] research (Analyst) - Market/technical research (optional)
  - [ ] product-brief (Analyst) - Strategic product foundation

- [ ] **Phase 2: Planning** (Not Started)
  - [ ] plan-project (PM) - Create PRD/Tech-Spec (determines final level)
  - [ ] ux-spec (PM) - UX/UI specification (user flows, wireframes, components)

- [ ] **Phase 3: Solutioning** (Conditional - TBD based on project level)
  - [ ] solution-architecture (Architect) - Design overall architecture
  - [ ] tech-spec (Architect) - Epic-specific technical specs (JIT)

- [ ] **Phase 4: Implementation** (Not Started)
  - [ ] create-story (SM) - Draft stories from backlog (iterative)
  - [ ] story-ready (SM) - Approve story for development
  - [ ] story-context (SM) - Generate context XML
  - [ ] dev-story (DEV) - Implement stories (iterative)
  - [ ] story-approved (DEV) - Mark complete, advance queue

## Project Details

**Project Level:** TBD (will be determined in Phase 2)
- Level 0: Single atomic change (1 story)
- Level 1: Small feature (2-3 stories, 1 epic)
- Level 2: Medium project (multiple epics)
- Level 3: Complex system (subsystems, integrations)
- Level 4: Enterprise scale (multiple products)

**Project Type:** Web Application
**Greenfield/Brownfield:** Brownfield (existing codebase)
**Has UI Components:** Yes
**Documentation Status:** Needs comprehensive documentation

## Implementation Progress (Phase 4 Only)

*This section will be populated when Phase 4 begins*

**Story Queue:**
- BACKLOG: TBD
- TODO: None
- IN PROGRESS: None
- DONE: 0 stories (0 points)

## What to do next

**Next Action:** Generate comprehensive codebase documentation for the brownfield JobSearchAI project

**Command to run:** `@analyst` then select `*document-project`

**Agent to load:** Analyst (Mary)

**Why this step:** For brownfield projects with incomplete documentation, generating comprehensive codebase documentation is essential before planning enhancements or new features. This documentation will inform all subsequent planning and architecture decisions.

## Workflow Notes

- **Phase 1 Analysis:** Started with document-project to establish solid foundation for brownfield codebase
- **UX Workflow:** Included in Phase 2 due to web application with UI components
- **Phase 3 Solutioning:** Will be determined based on project level assessment in Phase 2
- **Project Level:** Will be assessed during plan-project workflow in Phase 2
