- Level 1: Small feature (2-3 stories, 1 epic)
- Level 2: Medium project (multiple epics)
- Level 3: Complex system (subsystems, integrations)
- Level 4: Enterprise scale (multiple products)

**Project Type:** Web Application
**Greenfield/Brownfield:** Brownfield (existing codebase)
**Has UI Components:** Yes
**Documentation Status:** Needs comprehensive documentation

## Implementation Progress (Phase 4 Only)

*This section will be populated when Phase 4 begins*

**Story Queue:**
- BACKLOG: TBD
- TODO: None
- IN PROGRESS: None
- DONE: 0 stories (0 points)

## What to do next

**Next Action:** Explore enhancement ideas through brainstorming, or proceed to create product brief

**Command to run:** `@analyst` then select `*brainstorm-project` (optional) OR `*product-brief`

**Agent to load:** Analyst (Mary)

**Why this step:** With comprehensive documentation now complete, you can either:
1. **Brainstorm** potential enhancements and new features for the system
2. **Create Product Brief** to define strategic direction and goals

The brownfield documentation in `docs/` will inform all planning decisions.

## Workflow Notes

- **Phase 1 Analysis:** ✓ Completed document-project - Generated 6 comprehensive documentation files (Deep Scan)
- **UX Workflow:** Included in Phase 2 due to web application with UI components
- **Phase 3 Solutioning:** Will be determined based on project level assessment in Phase 2
- **Project Level:** Will be assessed during plan-project workflow in Phase 2
