# Session Summary (April 21, 2025 - Afternoon)

This session focused on improving the job detail extraction logic within `motivation_letter_generator.py` and fixing related issues in the dashboard display.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Refactored Job Detail Extraction (`motivation_letter_generator.py`):**
    *   Replaced the initial ScrapeGraph-only approach for fetching job details.
    *   Implemented a multi-step process in `get_job_details`:
        *   **Attempt 1: Iframe Extraction:** Tries to find a specific iframe (`vacancyDetailIFrame`) on the job page, extract its text, and structure it using OpenAI. If the iframe isn't found, it now returns the main page's parsed HTML (`BeautifulSoup` object) instead of failing immediately.
        *   **Attempt 2: PDF Link in HTML:** If the iframe method doesn't return structured details but provides the main page's HTML, the code now searches this HTML for links pointing to PDF files (containing `/preview/pdf` or ending in `.pdf`). If found, it attempts to process the linked PDF using the PDF/OCR method.
        *   **Attempt 3: Direct PDF Check (HEAD Request):** If no iframe was found and no usable PDF link was found in the HTML, it performs a `HEAD` request on the *original* job URL to check its `Content-Type`. If it's `application/pdf`, it proceeds with the PDF/OCR method on the original URL.
        *   **Attempt 4: Fallback:** If all direct extraction methods fail, it falls back to searching the latest pre-scraped data file (`get_job_details_from_scraped_data`).
2.  **Added PDF/OCR Processing (`motivation_letter_generator.py`):**
    *   Created a new function `get_job_details_from_pdf` that downloads a PDF from a URL.
    *   It first tries to extract text using PyMuPDF (`fitz`).
    *   If PyMuPDF extracts minimal text (below a threshold), it assumes an image-based PDF and uses `easyocr` (if available) to perform OCR on images rendered from the PDF pages.
    *   The extracted text (either direct or via OCR) is then sent to OpenAI for structuring.
3.  **Improved Scraped Data Parsing (`motivation_letter_generator.py`):**
    *   Fixed a `TypeError` in `get_job_details_from_scraped_data` by correctly handling the list-of-lists structure sometimes present in the scraped JSON files. It now flattens the list before searching.
4.  **Updated Dependencies (`requirements.txt`):**
    *   Added `easyocr`, `Pillow`, and `numpy` to support the new OCR functionality.
5.  **Enhanced Results Page (`dashboard.py` & `templates/results.html`):**
    *   Initially modified to disable "Generate Letter" buttons if the associated CV couldn't be determined from the report JSON.
    *   Revised approach: Added a CV selection dropdown to the results page.
        *   The dropdown lists all available CVs (based on `_summary.txt` files).
        *   It defaults to the CV associated with the report (if found in the JSON `cv_path`) or the first available CV otherwise.
        *   The user can manually select the desired CV before generating letters.
    *   Updated JavaScript (`static/js/main.js`) to read the selected CV from the dropdown when generating letters.
6.  **Fixed File Detection Logic (`dashboard.py`):**
    *   Corrected the logic in the `view_results` function for checking if generated files (HTML letter, DOCX letter, scraped data JSON) exist.
    *   It now reliably links the job match displayed on the results page to its corresponding `_scraped_data.json` file by comparing **Application URLs** (parsed to compare paths robustly).
    *   Once the correct `_scraped_data.json` is found, it uses the `Job Title` stored *within that file* to construct the correct filenames for checking the `.html`, `.json`, and `.docx` files using `pathlib`, resolving inconsistencies caused by title variations.
    *   Corrected multiple indentation errors introduced during previous modification attempts.

**Outcome:**

The job detail extraction should be significantly more robust, handling iframes, direct PDF links found in HTML, direct PDF URLs (including image-based ones via OCR), and falling back to pre-scraped data gracefully. The results page should now correctly display the "View Letter", "Download Word", and "View Scraped Data" options by reliably matching job entries to their generated files based on Application URLs.

**Known Issue:**

*   There appears to be an intermittent issue where the "View Letter", "Download Word", and "View Scraped Data" options in the Actions dropdown on the results page are not always displayed correctly, even after generating the corresponding files. Further investigation is needed.
