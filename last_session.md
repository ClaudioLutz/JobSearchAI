# Last Session Detailed Summary

## Motivation Letter Feature Exploration and Enhancement

### Overview
This session focused on understanding, improving, and extending the motivation letter generation feature within the JobsearchAI system. The goal was to enable generation of personalized, well-formatted motivation letters with enhanced styling and address handling.

## Current Session: Word Template Approach Update

### Overview
This session focused on updating the Word template generation approach from using bookmarks to using the docxtpl library with Jinja2-style variables. This change simplifies template creation and maintenance while providing better visual feedback in the template document.

### Detailed Steps and Actions

#### 1. Analysis of YouTube Video Technique
- Reviewed screenshots from a YouTube video showing an alternative approach to Word template generation
- Identified the use of docxtpl library and Jinja2-style variables as a simpler alternative to bookmarks
- Analyzed the differences between the current bookmark-based approach and the Jinja2 template approach

#### 2. Implementation of docxtpl Approach
- Installed the docxtpl library: `pip install docxtpl`
- Updated the Word template to use Jinja2-style variables (e.g., `{{ variable_name }}`) instead of bookmarks
- Completely refactored `word_template_generator.py` to use the DocxTemplate class from docxtpl
- Maintained the same function signatures for backward compatibility
- Added docxtpl to requirements.txt

#### 3. Testing the New Implementation
- Created a test script (`test_word_template.py`) with sample data to verify the functionality
- Successfully generated a test document using the new template and code
- Verified that all variables are correctly replaced in the output document

#### 4. Documentation
- Created `template_update.md` to document the changes made to the template approach
- Updated `last_session.md` to include information about the current session
- Documented the required variables for the template and the benefits of the new approach

### Detailed Steps and Actions

#### 1. Initial Exploration
- **Documentation Review**: Thoroughly read `Documentation.md` to understand the system architecture, especially the motivation letter generator component.
- **Code Analysis**: Examined `motivation_letter_generator.py` to understand how the system:
  - Loads CV summaries.
  - Extracts job details via ScrapeGraph AI or pre-scraped data.
  - Generates motivation letters using OpenAI GPT-4o with a detailed German prompt.
  - Outputs structured JSON and HTML formats.
- **Template Review**: Inspected `motivation_letter.html` to see how generated letters are rendered in the web interface.
- **Dashboard Integration**: Analyzed `dashboard.py` to understand how motivation letter generation is triggered, processed asynchronously, and displayed/downloaded by users.

#### 2. Word Document Styling Approach
- Discussed options for styling Word documents:
  - Programmatic styling with `python-docx` (complex and limited).
  - Using a pre-designed Word template with placeholders (preferred for flexibility and ease).
- User chose the pre-designed Word template approach.

#### 3. Template-Based Word Document Generation
- Created a Word template with placeholders like `[CANDIDATE_NAME]`, `[SUBJECT]`, etc.
- Developed initial code in `word_template_generator.py` to replace placeholders with JSON data.
- Encountered issues with styled placeholders (e.g., bold text) not being replaced correctly due to text runs splitting placeholders.

#### 4. Switching to Word Bookmarks
- Recommended replacing placeholders with Word bookmarks to preserve styling.
- User updated the Word template to use bookmarks instead of plain text placeholders.
- Updated `word_template_generator.py` to replace bookmark content by manipulating the underlying XML, preserving styles.
- Fixed bookmark name matching to use exact bookmark names without brackets and in lowercase.

#### 5. Address Field Refinement
- User requested splitting the `company_address` field into two separate fields:
  - `company_street_number`
  - `company_plz_city`
- Updated `word_template_generator.py` to handle these two separate placeholders.
- Discussed the need to update the prompt in `motivation_letter_generator.py` accordingly.

#### 6. Prompt Update Challenges
- Attempted to update the prompt in `motivation_letter_generator.py` to reflect the split address fields.
- Faced difficulties due to the large prompt text and exact matching requirements for replacement.
- Proposed reading the current prompt from the file for precise editing or having the user provide the exact prompt text.

#### 7. Prompt Update Implementation
- Successfully updated the prompt in `motivation_letter_generator.py` to include the split address fields:
  - Fixed a missing comma in the JSON template after the `company_plz_city` field, which would have caused JSON parsing errors.
  - Ensured the prompt correctly specifies both `company_street_number` and `company_plz_city` fields.
- Updated the `json_to_html` function to properly handle the new split address fields:
  - Modified the variable extraction to use `company_street_number` and `company_plz_city` instead of `company_address`.
  - Updated the HTML template to display these fields on separate lines.
- These changes ensure that the generated JSON includes the correct fields and that both the HTML output and Word document generation process correctly handle the split address fields.

#### 8. Documentation
- Created `last_session.md` to document all the work done, including exploration, implementation, challenges, and solutions.
- Expanded documentation to include detailed explanations of each step, technical challenges, and solutions.
- Updated documentation to reflect the successful implementation of the prompt updates.

### Outstanding Tasks and Next Steps
- ✅ Update the prompt in `motivation_letter_generator.py` to include `company_street_number` and `company_plz_city` instead of a single `company_address`. (Completed)
- ✅ Update the Word template generation approach to use docxtpl with Jinja2-style variables. (Completed)
- ✅ Create a test script to verify the functionality of the new template approach. (Completed)
- ✅ Document the changes made to the template approach. (Completed)
- Test the full motivation letter generation flow with the updated Word template and prompt.
- Consider creating a backup of the bookmark-based template (motivation_letter_template_bookmarks.docx) for reference.
- Further refine error handling and user feedback in the motivation letter generation process if needed.

### Summary
This session significantly enhanced the motivation letter generation feature by enabling styled Word document output using bookmarks and implementing more granular address data handling. The system is now better equipped to produce professional, personalized motivation letters with flexible styling and accurate data insertion. The prompt in `motivation_letter_generator.py` has been successfully updated to generate JSON with the split address fields, and both the HTML output and Word document generation process have been updated to handle these fields correctly.

The current session further improved the Word template generation process by replacing the bookmark-based approach with a more user-friendly and maintainable approach using the docxtpl library and Jinja2-style variables. This change simplifies template creation and maintenance, provides better visual feedback in the template document, and reduces the complexity of the code. The system now uses a more modern and flexible approach to Word document generation while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.

This detailed documentation will assist future development and maintenance of the motivation letter functionality in JobsearchAI.
