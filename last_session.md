# Development Session: Enhanced Job Matching with Career Trajectory and Satisfaction Analysis

## Overview

In this development session, we enhanced the JobsearchAI system to not only match candidates with jobs based on their qualifications but also to predict if the candidate would actually like the job based on their career trajectory and preferences.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced CV Processing

Modified `process_cv/cv_processor.py` to extract additional information from CVs:
- Career trajectory and development patterns
- Job preferences (industry, company size, work environment)
- Career goals and aspirations
- Job satisfaction indicators from previous positions
- Work values and cultural preferences

The CV processor now uses a more comprehensive prompt that specifically asks for these aspects when analyzing a candidate's resume.

### 2. Enhanced Job Matching Algorithm

Updated `job_matcher.py` to evaluate three new metrics:
- **Career Trajectory Alignment (1-10)**: How well the job aligns with the candidate's career path
- **Preference Match (1-10)**: How well the job matches the candidate's stated preferences
- **Potential Satisfaction (1-10)**: Prediction of how satisfied the candidate would be

The job matcher now considers not just if a candidate is qualified for a job, but also if they would likely enjoy and thrive in the position.

### 3. Updated Results Display

Modified `templates/results.html` to display the new metrics in both:
- The job matches table view
- The detailed job cards view

This gives users a more comprehensive understanding of each job match.

### 4. Updated Documentation

Updated documentation files to reflect the new features:
- `Documentation.md`: Added detailed information about the enhanced matching algorithm and CV processing
- `README.md`: Updated the overview, data preparation, matching engine, and output sections

## Testing

The enhanced system was tested with sample CVs and job listings. The new metrics provide valuable insights into job compatibility beyond just skills and qualifications.

## Future Work

Potential next steps to further enhance this feature:
1. Implement a feedback mechanism where candidates can rate job suggestions to improve the preference and satisfaction predictions
2. Add visualization of career trajectory and potential future paths
3. Integrate with company culture databases for better cultural fit assessment
4. Allow customizable weighting of different matching factors (skills vs. satisfaction)
5. Develop a more sophisticated career trajectory analysis that can identify patterns across industries and roles
