# Story 1.4: Application Queue Integration Bridge

Status: Approved ✅

## Story

As a **job applicant using JobSearchAI**,
I want **an automated bridge that connects my matched jobs and generated motivation letters to the application queue**,
so that **I can efficiently review and send multiple applications without manual file manipulation**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-1: Data Bridge Implementation**
   - Create bridge service that aggregates match + letter + scraped data
   - Extract recipient email and name from job details
   - Transform combined data into queue application JSON format
   - Generate unique collision-free application IDs using UUID
   - Save queue applications to `job_matches/pending/` directory
   - Handle missing data gracefully with clear error messages

2. **AC-2: URL Consistency**
   - Create centralized URLNormalizer utility class
   - Store full URLs (not relative paths) in match JSON
   - Add `application_url` field to letter JSON during generation
   - Implement normalized URL comparison for matching
   - Fallback to job ID extraction when URL comparison fails

3. **AC-3: Results Page Integration**
   - Add "Send to Queue" button on job matching results page
   - Implement multi-select checkboxes for job selection
   - Show "Already has letter" indicator for jobs with existing letters
   - Display clear success/error messages after queuing
   - Link from success message to queue dashboard

4. **AC-4: Email Extraction and Fallback**

   - Detect generic emails (jobs@, hr@, careers@) and show warnings
   - Provide manual email input fallback when extraction fails
   - Validate email format before queuing
   - Store email quality assessment with application

5. **AC-5: Duplicate Detection**
   - Check pending queue for existing applications (same company + title)
   - Show warning dialog before queuing duplicates
   - Allow user to confirm or cancel duplicate submissions
   - Log duplicate attempts for user awareness

6. **AC-6: Required Field Validation**
   - Validate all required fields before creating queue file
   - Required: id, job_title, company_name, subject_line, motivation_letter, application_url, status
   - Recommended: recipient_email, recipient_name
   - Fail fast with specific error messages for missing fields
   - Prevent silent failures from incomplete data

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Adapter/Transformer Pattern:**
The bridge implements the Adapter/Transformer architectural pattern to convert heterogeneous job matching artifacts into a unified application queue format. This maintains separation of concerns while enabling clean data transformation.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Keep separate data schemas for matcher, letter generator, and queue
- Use ApplicationContext as transient data structure during transformation
- Centralize URL handling in single service (URLNormalizer)
- Abstract storage layer even while using file-based storage for easy future migration
- Implement fail-fast validation to prevent silent failures

**Critical Safety Fixes (from FMEA Analysis):**
1. **UUID-based IDs** - Prevents race conditions from timestamp collisions
2. **Required field validation** - Prevents silent failures from incomplete data
3. **Email quality warnings** - Prevents 30-70% failure rate from generic emails

**Data Flow Architecture:**
```
[Matcher] → match JSON (full URL)
     ↓
[Letter Generator] → letter JSON (+ URL)
     ↓
[User clicks "Send to Queue"]
     ↓
[Bridge Service]
  ├─ Reads: match JSON + letter JSON + scraped_data JSON
  ├─ Extracts: recipient email/name from job details
  ├─ Combines: all data into ApplicationContext
  ├─ Transforms: to queue application JSON format
  ├─ Validates: required fields + email quality
  └─ Saves: to job_matches/pending/*.json
     ↓
[Queue Dashboard] → Displays applications
     ↓
[Email Sender] → Sends applications
```

**URL Consistency Strategy:**
- Store full URLs everywhere (not relative paths)
- Use normalized comparison for matching (strip protocol, www, trailing slash)
- Fallback to job ID extraction if URL comparison fails
- Single source of truth: URLNormalizer service

**Error Handling Philosophy:**
- Fail fast with specific error messages
- User-friendly messages (no technical jargon)
- Log technical details for debugging
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Clear action items for users
