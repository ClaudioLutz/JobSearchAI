## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Flask Blueprint Pattern:**
- Follow existing blueprint structure (see blueprints/job_matching_routes.py)
- URL prefix: `/queue`
- Blueprint name: `queue`
- Use `@login_required` decorator for authentication

**File-based Storage Pattern:**
- JSON files in job_matches/pending/ for pending applications
- Move to job_matches/sent/ after successful send
- Move to job_matches/failed/ on send failure
- File naming: `app_{timestamp}_{id}.json`

**UI/UX Principles:**
- Card-based layout for scanability
- Color-coded status (green=ready, yellow=review, blue=sent)
- Progress bars for visual completeness indication
- Confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental sends
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)

**AJAX Interaction Pattern:**
- Use Fetch API or jQuery AJAX
- Return JSON responses from Flask routes
- Update UI without page reload
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**

dashboard.py                       # MODIFIED - Register new blueprint
```

**No Conflicts Detected:**
- New blueprint follows existing pattern
- Templates use existing Bootstrap 5
- JavaScript follows existing patterns
- No route conflicts
