## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Integration Testing Strategy:**
- Use pytest for Python integration tests
- Mock external dependencies (SMTP, OpenAI API)
- Test complete workflows end-to-end
- Focus on integration points between modules
- Document test scenarios and expected results

**Error Handling Philosophy:**
- User-friendly error messages (no technical jargon)
- Log technical details for debugging
- Graceful degradation (non-critical failures don't break app)
- Clear action items for user (e.g., "Check Gmail credentials")
- Consistent error format across all modules

**Performance Considerations:**
- Lazy load applications (pagination if queue grows large)
- Optimize file I/O operations
- Cache validation results where appropriate
- Minimize DOM manipulation in JavaScript
- Use efficient selectors and event delegation

- Integration tests complement existing unit tests
- Documentation updates enhance existing docs
- Performance optimizations don't change functionality
