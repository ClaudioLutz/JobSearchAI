# JobSearchAI Pipeline - Advanced Elicitation Insights (Part 2)

**Continued from Part 1...**

# Part 4: Agile Team Perspective Shift (Continued)

## 🏃 Scrum Master Perspective (Continued)

**Sprint 3: Letter Generation**
- Story 7: Mini model detailed scoring (8 pts)
- Story 8: German letter template generation (13 pts)
- Story 9: Manual review UI (8 pts)
- **Total: 29 pts** (may need to move story 9 to Sprint 4)

### Blockers & Dependencies

- ⚠️ **Blocker**: OpenAI API key and usage limits need clarification
- ⚠️ **Blocker**: Legal review of scraping strategy (could delay Sprint 1)
- ⚠️ **Dependency**: CV processor exists but needs validation for profile extraction
- ⚠️ **Dependency**: User auth system exists but needs profile schema extension

### Team Dynamics Risks

- 🔴 **Single Point of Failure**: Architecture assumes one developer familiar with both ML/AI and web scraping
- 🟡 **Knowledge Silos**: Trafilatura, vector databases, prompt engineering require specialized knowledge
- 🟢 **Positive**: Team has existing Flask/SQLite experience to leverage

### Process Recommendations

1. **Daily Standup Focus**: Track API quota usage daily to avoid surprise costs
2. **Definition of Done**: Include "tested with 10 real job postings" for extraction stories
3. **Sprint Review**: Demo with live job board data, not test fixtures
4. **Retrospective Topics**: Discuss LLM prompt engineering learnings to build team capability

### Key SM Concern
> "The architecture is technically sound but complex for a single developer. Consider phased delivery: V1 without vector DB, add it in V2 when scale demands it."

## 💻 Developer Perspective

### Technical Implementation Complexity

**Easy (1-2 days each):**
- ✅ CV text extraction (existing `cv_processor.py`)
- ✅ URL collection with requests library
- ✅ SQLite schema for jobs table
- ✅ Basic Trafilatura integration

**Medium (3-5 days each):**
- ⚠️ OpenAI Structured Outputs integration (new API format)
- ⚠️ JSON-LD parsing with quality validation
- ⚠️ Profile extraction from CV (LLM prompt engineering required)
- ⚠️ Letter generation with German language validation

**Hard (1-2 weeks each):**
- 🔴 Vector database integration (Qdrant setup + embedding pipeline)
- 🔴 Anti-detection proxy rotation (if Playwright fallback needed)
- 🔴 Feedback loop with model retraining
- 🔴 Multi-stage pipeline orchestration with error handling

### Code Architecture Concerns

**ANTI-PATTERN RISK:**
```python
# Monolithic scraper function - AVOID THIS
def scrape_job():
    url = collect_url()
    dedupe_check = check_hash(url)
    if dedupe_check: return
    nano_result = nano_gate(url)
    if not nano_result: return
    html = fetch(url)
    content = extract_jsonld(html) or trafilatura(html) or playwright(html)
    embedding = generate_embedding(content)
    if check_duplicate_embedding(embedding): return
    mini_result = mini_score(content)
    letter = generate_letter(mini_result)
    save_to_db(...)
    
# This becomes unmaintainable! Each step needs:
# - Retry logic
# - Error handling
# - Logging
# - Metrics
# - Testing
```

**RECOMMENDED PATTERN:**
```python
# Pipeline with discrete stages
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional

@dataclass
class JobCandidate:
    url: str
    title: str
    source: str
    stage: str  # "collected", "filtered", "extracted", "scored", "generated"
    error: Optional[str] = None

class JobPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stages = [
            URLCollector(),
            URLDeduplicator(),
            NanoFilter(),
            ContentExtractor(),
            EmbeddingDeduplicator(),
            MiniScorer(),
            LetterGenerator()
        ]
    
    def process(self, job: JobCandidate):
        for stage in self.stages:
            try:
                job = stage.execute(job)
                if job.error:
                    break  # Pipeline halts on error
            except Exception as e:
                job.error = str(e)
                log_error(job, stage, e)
                break
        return job

# Each stage is testable in isolation
# Each stage has clear input/output contract
# Stages can be swapped/reordered easily
```

### Technical Debt Risks

- 🔴 **High Risk**: Hardcoded prompts → move to config/database for easy A/B testing
- 🟡 **Medium Risk**: No retry logic for API calls → will cause failures
- 🟡 **Medium Risk**: No rate limiting → will hit quota limits unexpectedly
- 🟢 **Low Risk**: SQLite for V1 → migrate to PostgreSQL later if needed

### Key Dev Concern
> "The vector database + proxy rotation adds significant complexity. Can we ship V1 without these and add in V2 based on actual usage patterns?"

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Estimated setup time: 4 hours
- Install Trafilatura + dependencies
- Set up OpenAI API key with usage alerts
- Configure local Qdrant (if V1) or stub it
- Set up test fixtures with 10 sample job postings
- Configure linting (Black, Pylint) for consistency
```

## 🧪 QA Perspective

### Critical Test Scenarios

**1. Profile Extraction Quality:**
```gherkin
Given: A CV with 5 years Python experience, Bachelor's degree, Zurich location
When: Profile extraction runs
Then: 
  - skills list contains "Python" (5 years)
  - location preference is "Zurich"
  - seniority level is "Senior"
  - profile completeness score > 80%

Edge Cases:
  - CV with mixed languages (DE/EN)
  - CV with unconventional format
  - CV missing key information (no degree, no location)
```

**2. Matching Accuracy:**
```gherkin
Given: Profile with "Python, Flask, SQL" skills
When: Evaluating job: "Senior Python Developer - Django, PostgreSQL"
Then:
  - match_score > 70 (high overlap)
  - skill_matches includes ["Python", "SQL"]
  - skill_gaps includes ["Django"] (close enough to Flask)
  - confidence > 0.7

False Positive Test:
  Given: Profile with "Python" (data science focus)
  When: Evaluating "Python Developer - Embedded Systems"
  Then: match_score < 50 (domain mismatch)

False Negative Test:
  Given: Profile with "JavaScript, React"
  When: Evaluating "Frontend Engineer - Vue.js"
  Then: match_score > 60 (framework similarity)
```

**3. Extraction Resilience:**
```gherkin
Scenario: JSON-LD Success
  Given: Job page with complete JobPosting markup
  When: Extraction runs
  Then: Uses JSON-LD, extraction_time < 1 second

Scenario: JSON-LD Incomplete
  Given: Job page with partial JobPosting (title only)
  When: Extraction runs
  Then: Falls through to Trafilatura, extraction_time < 3 seconds

Scenario: JavaScript-Heavy Site
  Given: Job page requiring JS execution
  When: Trafilatura fails
  Then: Pipeline gracefully returns error (no Playwright in V1)

Scenario: Consent Wall
  Given: Job page with GDPR consent modal
  When: Extraction runs
  Then: Trafilatura extracts content (if HTML is in page source)
  Otherwise: Pipeline gracefully returns error
```

**4. Letter Quality Gates:**
```gherkin
Given: Generated German letter for "Senior Backend Engineer"
Then:
  - letter_length between 300-600 words
  - contains company name
  - contains position title
  - mentions at least 2 relevant skills from CV
  - uses formal German (Sie, nicht Du)
  - passes AI detection score > 50% human-like
  - no placeholder text like "[Your Name]" remains

Quality Checks:
  - Grammar check (LanguageTool API)
  - Readability score (Flesch-Reading-Ease for German)
  - Keyword coverage (job requirements vs letter content)
```

### Non-Functional Requirements Testing

**Performance:**
- [ ] Pipeline processes 100 URLs → 10 matched jobs in < 10 minutes
- [ ] Letter generation for 1 job in < 30 seconds
- [ ] Database query for "show my matches" in < 500ms

**Reliability:**
- [ ] API failures retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- [ ] Pipeline continues on single job failure (doesn't crash entire batch)
- [ ] Rate limit errors pause for 60s and retry

**Security:**
- [ ] OpenAI API key not hardcoded (environment variable)
- [ ] User passwords hashed (existing auth system)
- [ ] No PII logged in debug logs
- [ ] Scraped data encrypted at rest (if required by Swiss FADP)

**Usability:**
- [ ] Manual review UI shows job match score explanation
- [ ] User can edit generated letter before submission
- [ ] Clear error messages when job cannot be processed
- [ ] Dashboard shows processing status (X jobs collected, Y filtered, Z matched)

### Test Automation Priority

**P0 (Must automate):**
- Profile extraction accuracy (unit tests)
- Matching logic with known good/bad pairs (integration tests)
- Letter generation with fixtures (integration tests)

**P1 (Should automate):**
- Full pipeline end-to-end with test job boards
- Deduplication logic with synthetic duplicates
- API retry logic with mock failures

**P2 (Manual testing acceptable for V1):**
- Anti-detection effectiveness (requires real job boards)
- Letter human-likeness scoring (requires human judgment)
- Multi-lingual support (not in V1 scope)

### Key QA Concern
> "The pipeline has many failure points (API quota, extraction failures, LLM hallucinations). We need comprehensive error handling and monitoring, not just happy path testing."

### Quality Metrics Dashboard
```yaml
metrics_to_track:
  - URL collection success rate (%)
  - Nano gate pass rate (%)
  - Extraction method distribution (JSON-LD vs Trafilatura vs Error %)
  - Deduplication rate (%)
  - Mini model match rate (%)
  - Letter generation success rate (%)
  - End-to-end pipeline success rate (%)
  - Average cost per processed job ($)
  - User satisfaction (thumbs up/down on matches)
```

## 🎯 Synthesized Team Consensus

### What All Roles Agree On:
1. ✅ **MVP Scope**: CV profile → ostjob.ch scraping → two-stage matching → German letters
2. ✅ **Defer to V2**: Vector DB, anti-detection proxies, Playwright fallback, multi-site aggregation
3. ✅ **Critical Path**: Profile extraction quality determines everything downstream
4. ✅ **User Control**: Manual review step is non-negotiable for trust and quality

### Key Trade-offs:
- **Speed vs Cost**: Nano gate essential for cost control, even if some matches missed
- **Automation vs Control**: Suggest matches + assist, don't auto-apply (PO + Dev align)
- **Simplicity vs Resilience**: Accept higher failure rate in V1, add resilience in V2 (SM + QA align)

### Action Items for Next Planning Meeting:
1. **PO**: Define exact success metrics (% relevant matches, user satisfaction threshold)
2. **SM**: Create detailed sprint 1 stories with acceptance criteria
3. **Dev**: Spike on Trafilatura effectiveness with 20 ostjob.ch samples
4. **QA**: Build test fixture set with 10 known job postings (good/bad matches)
