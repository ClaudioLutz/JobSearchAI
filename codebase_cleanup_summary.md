# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup performed on the JobsearchAI codebase to remove unused files following the optimization process described in `README_OPTIMIZATION.md`.

## Files Moved to Deprecated Directory

The following files were identified as unused or redundant and have been moved to a timestamped deprecated directory (`deprecated_20250427_211727`) instead of being deleted outright:

1. **`test.py`**: A standalone test script for ScrapeGraphAI with hardcoded API keys.
   - Not imported by any other files
   - Functionality now available in `graph_scraper_utils.py`

2. **`create_directories.py`**: Simple script that creates necessary directories for CV processing.
   - Directory creation now handled by the centralized configuration (`config.py`) which has `config.ensure_dir()` functionality
   - The script was only needed for initial setup

3. **`test_word_template.py`**: Standalone test script for the word template generator.
   - Not part of the main test suite
   - Used only for manual testing of word template functionality

4. **`future_low_effort_features.md`**: Documentation of potential future features.
   - Contains "Centralize Configuration" (item #20) which has already been implemented according to `README_OPTIMIZATION.md`
   - Suggests the document may be outdated

## Remaining Dependencies

Note that `graph_scraper_utils.py` was identified as a potential candidate for removal but was **kept in place** because:

1. It is still imported in `job_details_utils.py`
2. The imports have fallback mechanisms suggesting it might be in the process of being phased out
3. Complete removal would require additional verification that all functionality has been integrated elsewhere

## Recovery Process

If any of the moved files need to be restored, you can use the following command:

```bash
# To restore a specific file
mv deprecated_20250427_211727/filename .

# To restore all files
mv deprecated_20250427_211727/* .
```

## Next Steps

1. Review the optimized components to ensure they fully replace the functionality of the deprecated files
2. Update the documentation to reflect the changes made to the codebase
3. Consider removing `graph_scraper_utils.py` in the future if its functionality is fully integrated into the optimized modules
4. If no issues arise in the next few weeks, the deprecated directory can be safely removed
