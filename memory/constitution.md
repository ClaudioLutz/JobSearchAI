# JobSearchAI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Data Privacy & Security (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Personal CV data must remain secure and confidential at all times. All user data handling must comply with privacy standards. No personal information should be logged in plain text or exposed through debugging. Database access must be controlled and encrypted where possible.

### II. Quality Standards
Job matching accuracy must exceed 80% based on user feedback and evaluation metrics. All matching algorithms must be tested and validated before deployment. Quality degradation must be detected and addressed immediately.

### III. Performance Requirements
System response times must remain under 2 seconds for all user-facing operations. CV processing, job matching, and document generation must be optimized for speed. Performance monitoring and alerting must be implemented for critical paths.

### IV. Technology Stack Compatibility
All new features must work with the existing Flask/SQLite technology stack. Maintain backward compatibility with current database schema. New dependencies must be justified and approved. Migration paths must be defined for any breaking changes.

### V. User Experience Consistency
Maintain current UI/UX patterns and design consistency. All new features must integrate seamlessly with existing interface. User workflows must remain intuitive and familiar. Documentation must be updated for any interface changes.

## Technical Constraints

### Development Environment
- **Python Version**: 3.11+ required
- **Framework**: Flask-based architecture mandatory
- **Database**: SQLite for development, migration path to PostgreSQL documented
- **Dependencies**: Manage via requirements.txt, prefer lightweight libraries
- **Testing**: Unit tests required for all new functionality

### Architecture Requirements
- **Modularity**: New features must use blueprint pattern
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic separated from presentation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management

### Integration Standards
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints where applicable
- **Data Processing**: Async processing for heavy operations
- **File Handling**: Secure upload and storage mechanisms
- **External Services**: Robust error handling for external dependencies

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Gates
- All code must pass linting and formatting checks
- Unit tests required with >80% coverage for new features
- Integration tests for critical user workflows
- Security scanning for dependencies and code
- Performance benchmarking for critical paths

### Documentation Requirements
- Technical specifications for all new features
- API documentation for new endpoints
- User guide updates for interface changes
- Deployment and configuration documentation
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues

### Review Process
- All changes require code review and approval
- Architecture decisions must be documented and justified
- Breaking changes require migration guides
- Security-sensitive changes require additional review
- Performance impacts must be measured and documented

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Any amendments require documentation, stakeholder approval, and a clear migration plan.
