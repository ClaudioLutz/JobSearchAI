I've set up your Python environment for the job-data-acquisition project:

Created a Python virtual environment in the job-data-acquisition folder
Activated the virtual environment
Installed the required dependencies: scrapegraphai and playwright
Run playwright install to set up the necessary browser drivers
Created a dependencies.txt file listing the required packages
Your Python environment is now ready for development. The virtual environment is activated, and all necessary dependencies are installed.

I've set up the job data acquisition project with the ScrapeGraph AI library as requested. Here's what I've implemented:

app.py: The main application script that:

Imports the SmartScraperGraph component from scrapegraphai
Loads configuration from settings.json
Sets up logging for troubleshooting
Configures the scraper with gpt-4o-mini model, token limits, and headless mode
Defines a detailed extraction prompt for job data (title, company, description, skills, location, salary, date, URL)
Implements functions to run the scraper and save results to JSON files
configs/settings.json: Configuration file with:

Scraper settings (model="gpt-4o-mini", max_tokens=4096, temperature=0.2)
Browser options (headless=true)
Verbose logging for troubleshooting
Target URL (https://www.ostjob.ch/job/alle-jobs)
Data storage and logging paths
test_scraper.py: A utility script to test the scraper configuration and run limited test scrapes without executing the full application.

README.md: Documentation explaining the project setup, configuration, and usage.

The application is designed to extract structured job data from OstJob and save it as JSON files with timestamps. The scraper is configured to use gpt-4o-mini as requested, with appropriate token limits and settings for handling JavaScript-rendered content.

To run the application, simply activate the virtual environment and execute:

python job-data-acquisition/app.py
